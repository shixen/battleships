# Battleships

battleships is an board game and was first introduced as early as in world war 1 where soldiers would play this with a paper and a pencil.
the point of the game is to guess a random hidden ship on the map.
the player gets 10 turns to try and guess the ship by entering first a row between 0-4 followed by a column 0-4
when the player uses all of the turns the game is over and an option to play again.

# How to play
user stars buy entering a username
the users job is then to find the hidden ship on the map 
guesses are done by entering first a number between 1-4 to guess a row
the same follows to enter a column 1-4
once a turn is complete the map will show where you hit and tell you if its a miss or a hit
this process is repeted untill 10 turns is made or the ship has been hit

# Design
i decided to go with an simple approach to the game to keep it clean and simple at the same time
i use X to mark where a miss was made because its easy to keep track of and simple to see.
and i used the @ to mark where the ship was when it was hit 
and a 5x5 board to not overcomplicate things.

# Testing

validation ?
